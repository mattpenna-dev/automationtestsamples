Validate that a Car object can be retrieved from the Car Service using the ID for the object.

Scenario: The Car Service will return the requested Car when trying to retrieve it by using the 
ID for that Car
Given that I have an ID JSON body of the request for a Car object that exist in the Car Service

And I should get the requested Car object in the JSON body of the response.
